# Titanic-Explore

Let's use the various models in scikit-learn on Titanic data, courtesy of Kaggle.

# Setup

This repo features various python3 notebooks that reads in and walks through each of the models available in Scikit Learn. These are jupyter notebooks running python3, and sklearn, obviously, so those are prerequisites.

Folders for each section in the [User's Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) all run and use the prep notebooks in the main folder.

# Notes

- For the 'embarked' column, the Titanic was loaded in Southhampton ('S'), stopped at Cherbourg ('C'), then one final stop at Queenstown ('Q'). When converting to ordinals, going to code 'S' => 1, 'C' => 2, 'Q' => 3 (Source: https://www.thoughtco.com/titanic-timeline-1779210, accessed 2019-03-11).
